	Resources
		In case you need a refresher on events and event listeners, here are some links.

		If you're writing Cat Clicker with vanilla JS (no jQuery), you'll be adding the "click" event with elem.addEventListener().

			var elem = document.getElementById('my-elem');
			elem.addEventListener('click', function(){
			  //the element has been clicked... do stuff here
			}, false);
		
		If you're using jQuery, you'll be adding the "click" event listener with jQuery.click().

			$('#my-elem').click(function(e) {
			  //the element has been clicked... do stuff here
			});
